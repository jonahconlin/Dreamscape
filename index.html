I believe UX Design is an industry in which diversity of experience, education and background is essential. If we are to understand, empathize with, and be the voice of our users as products and services are designed, we must strive to reflect those users as a practice by including colleagues from different points-of-view, backgrounds, and different sets of needs and experiences. I see the role of effective UX Design programs at community colleges as an ethical obligation of our field.

To double down on the ethical ramifications of design, I think cultural awareness, education, and sensitivity to cross-cultural norms, appropriation, and offensive material should play a bigger role in design education both at the university level and the workplace level. Far too often, even today, I see designers abusing their tools to execute culturally insensitive work...

I am currently conducting a survey of Diversity + Design, and am very interested in fostering diversity, equity and inclusion in design. This is a two-fold effort because it requires both HIRING designers of diverse backgrounds and enabling those designers to design for people who are not centered in our society (i.e., white, male, straight, American, able-bodied, neurotypical, etc.). In the 90's, it was estimated that design was 93% white. That means that our entire visual language is centering White culture, and we are failing to effectively reach other races and cultures in our visual language.

The most critical issue in design is the lack of diversity: racial (not enough non-white), economic (not enough low-income), geographic (not enough non-urban)

I focus on design in the accessibility sphere and making information more visually accessible. There isn't enough diversity and representation in types of design and messages communicated. Especially when it comes to Deaf designers who's native languages are visual. There needs to be more resources and support for creating more opportunities for accessible design and utilizing the strengths of visual language possessed by the Deaf.

For me personally, it's diversity on the team's I'm in. Most of the team's I was part of are predominately white with similar design styles and perspectives. Even the conferences that I'm attending are predominately white. I understand having more females is one form of expanding diversity, but I would like to see more walks of designers sharing their expertise and experiences.

I believe UX Design is an industry in which diversity of experience, education and background is essential. If we are to understand, empathize with, and be the voice of our users as products and services are designed, we must strive to reflect those users as a practice by including colleagues from different points-of-view, backgrounds, and different sets of needs and experiences. I see the role of effective UX Design programs at community colleges as an ethical obligation of our field.

...it seems that agencies are more concerned about hiring friends or people like them/their friends than on merit/skills in a businesslike fashion. This is part of the reason I believe I cannot secure a role at another agency.

Diversity in the workplace and limited junior design opportunities... I ended up taking the first job offered to me because of the fear that the opportunity would not come again...

There is a lack of diversity in Design and it reflects how things are produced and who they are produced for.

The best jobs for designers are with global brands that contribute in some way to poverty, discrimination, waste, and climate change. Because these jobs offer the best pay/benefits, and because young designers have loads of college debt, these jobs are attractive... As a freelancer, I'm able to work with smaller clients who do good in the world, and not for global brands. But that means I've chosen a route that will likely never bring me any awards or exposure, doesn't put me in close proximity to other designers... and offers me lower compensation with no benefits. I'd love to see the industry talk more about design's role in the greater good of the world...

In a world where designers create products that are voraciously sold to consumers we need to be conserving our resources, reducing our impact on the environment and sharing more. All this, while still delivering personal, functional, emotional products and experiences that people have come to expect.

I believe the most critical issues facing the design industry are an inwards, myopic dialogue that doesn't engage with larger communities, issues, etc (ex: book fair popularity vs dialogue on environmental impact). This is not specifically solved through social media engagement and visibility, something my younger students are frequently vocally skeptical about. I think there is a simultaneous challenge for designers these days to feel a sense of belonging to larger, less individualistic narratives, while focusing on personal growth, success, and self-development of their artistic and creative passions and goals. We need to seek better ways of forming more inclusive, less individualistic, coherent narratives together.

First, the design world is seemingly dominated by white men and women without disabilities, who in turn get to be the primary decision makers. This affects the entire direction of the profession, including dictating barriers for entry and determining overarching aesthetics. Conversely, I'm a firm believer that good design needs to be taught by a professional. There's a disconnect here where a proper design education is often out of reach of people who aren't rich, while professional training is still needed to foster a high quality of design excellence. In general, there's a lack of accessibility in the profession that needs to be addressed.

Design education could be pushing against design as a tool for capitalism but instead either feeds capitalism or sits in its own bubble acting like it has nothing to do with capitalism. Students aren't taught how to deal with the realities of the industries they are going into and instead are given a strange idealistic self involved view of design that is just a recipe for failure.

The word "design" has so many definitions, it is a vague term. For example "being" a designer can mean arranging walls with brainstormed words on sticky notes to actually making a design for something.  Some people have learned ""design thinking"" from years of experience and others by attending a sticky note workshop. What seems to be happening is the automation of a formulaic way to neatly package the creative aspects of design...

Design literacy broadly - as global economies continue to squeeze out thin margins because scaling old business models produce less profit and we move towards automation (and thus eliminating jobs), teaching people to think like a designer and drive more innovation is going to be more important than ever. Design needs to broaden its definition and design needs to increase overall literacy among "non-designers."

... Automation will also be cutting entry-level designers out of work as we grow towards a more knowledge-based economy that won't give entry an opportunity to warm into the pace of design --  it's advanced and fast, and clients expect this way of making.

The thing I fear most is automation, especially online services which create quick & cheap logos. I fear that business owners and other industries see this seemingly easy service and that then causes a decrease in our value (in their eyes). I think designers need to do more to educate other industries about why our skill sets are so vital.

I question the role for designers in an increasingly automated world, I feel in the present moment Graphic Designers are not appreciated enough and I do believe that Design positions may fall by the wayside with the rise of Automation, AI and Machine Learning... [we need] to prepare for a world where Designers may compete with algorithms.
